## Fetch Historical Data: 
The function first retrieves the stock's historical data using yfinance. It extracts the closing prices.
## Calculate Log Returns: 
Log returns are calculated from the historical closing prices. These are used as the basis for the Monte Carlo simulation.
## Monte Carlo Simulation: 
The simulation generates random returns for the next days based on the historical log returns. It then calculates the potential prices for each day, assuming the stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion (a common thing in financial modeling).
## Price Prediction: 
The function returns the minimum, maximum, mean, and median potential prices for the future days. These values give a range of possible outcomes for the stock price.
